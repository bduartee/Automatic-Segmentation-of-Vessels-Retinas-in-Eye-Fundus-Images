# Automatic-Segmentation-of-Vessels-Retinas-in-Eye-Fundus-Images
Segmentation of retinal vessels from a fundus image from the DRIVE dataset. 
The procedures advised in the article by Ricci et al (DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2007.898551) were used.

This work implements several features and an SVM. The segmentation results are presented in Figure (a) and the DRIVE's ground truth is in Figure (b).
